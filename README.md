# MCC-Modloader
A modloader for Halo the Master Chief Collection written in python.
I welcome and appreciate any useful contributions to this project.

Choosing A will start Halo MCC. If Halo MCC does not start, then make sure that the path is correct.
Choosing B will change Halo MCC into Vanilla mode. This allows the user to play online multiplayer and without any mod enabled.
Choosing C will change Halo MCC into Modded mode. This allows the user to play with mods, but may prevent the user from playing online multiplayer.
Choosing D will show the list of modded files that you have availible.
Choosing E will exit this program.
Choosing F will display this message.
To add a mod, make a copy of the original file and add ".original" to the file extension (e.g. file.map -> file.map.original).
Then add ".mod" to the file extension of the "mod" version of the file (e.g. file.map -> file.map.mod).
Both files should be in the same location as the original file.
Some(Few) mods do not require this modloader because they are allowed in online multiplayer.
