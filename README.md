# MCC-Modloader

A modloader for Halo the Master Chief Collection on PC.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple program that can provide a quick and easy way to swap between mods in MCC on both Steam and UWP. *(Expect Steam support to come first.)* This will work for anything from simple, single file mods (think Forge World enhancements), to total overhauls like campaign reworks.

Instructions will be added to this readme with the first release.

I'm gonna take this fork in a different direction. We'll see what happens.

This branch is for a complete rewrite with the Rust programming language. If all goes well, I'll stick to it. I'm learning the language as I go, so this could get interesting.
