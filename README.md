# MCC-Modloader
A modloader for Halo the Master Chief Collection written in python.
I welcome and appreciate any useful contributions to this project.

Choosing A will change Halo MCC into Vanilla mode. This allows the user to play online multiplayer and without any mod enabled.

Choosing B will change Halo MCC into Modded mode. This allows the user to play with mods, but may prevent the user from playing online multiplayer.

Choosing C will show the list of modded files that you have availible.

Choosing D will display this message.

Choosing E will exit this program.

To add a mod, make a copy of the original file and add ".original" to the file extension (e.g. file.map -> file.map.original). Then add ".mod" to the file extension of the "mod" version of the file (e.g. file.map -> file.map.mod). Both files should be in the same location as the original file.

Some(Few) mods do not require this modloader because they are allowed in online multiplayer.
